# Agpht - A Github Pages Helper Tool

This is a fork of https://github.com/maks/MGit to add bespoke support for managing Github Pages through MGit. All credit goes to the original creators.

Two new actions are added to the repo action drawer.

1) Copy To Repo: This action will open the file browser and allow you to select a file from your file system. This file will then be copied to the current directory of your current repo with a new name of your choosing. In my case this helps add pictures I have taken with my phone to my repo easily.

2) Template: This action will duplicate a file in the current directory called \_template.tp with a new name of your choosing. This facilitates creating new blog entries based on a repeatedly reused Markdown template.

Note: I recommend using another text editor when writing posts as the embedded text editing is not great.
